Usage: sudo $0 [--dry-run]

Rolls back the most recent Cinemata deploy by checking out the commit that
was HEAD before the last successful 'git pull' run by restart_script.sh,
then re-runs the build + service restart sequence.

Does NOT run 'manage.py migrate' on the rolled-back code. If migrations
changed between deploys, you must reverse them manually after rollback.

Options:
  --dry-run   Show what would happen without making any changes.
