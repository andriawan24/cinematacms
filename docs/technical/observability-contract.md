# Application observability contract

This reference defines the telemetry that CinemataCMS emits. A deployment owns storage, collector endpoints, retention, thresholds, alert routing, and credentials.

## Email delivery

`email_delivery.service.enqueue()` validates an `EmailEnvelope`, creates an `EmailDeliveryReceipt`, and publishes `deliver_email` after the database transaction commits. One task handles one recipient on `email_tasks`.

A receipt stores the delivery UUID, a versioned keyed recipient reference, the email kind, the state, the attempt count, the Celery task ID, a bounded reason code, and timestamps. It does not store an address, a subject, a message body, or an outbox copy.

`smtp_accepted` means that the SMTP server accepted the message. It does not prove inbox delivery. A worker crash can leave acceptance ambiguous. `recover_stale_email_deliveries` changes stale `sending` receipts to `unknown` and does not resend them.

Set `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_HMAC_KEY` to an external secret. Set `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_HMAC_VERSION` when you rotate the key. Keep the previous key outside the application for no longer than the 30-day receipt window. Run a worker that consumes only `email_tasks`. The task has a 30-second SMTP timeout and a 60-second hard limit.

## Celery and domain outcomes

Celery execution states are `started`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `retried`, and `revoked`. Queue labels are `long_tasks`, `short_tasks`, `whisper_tasks`, `email_tasks`, or `default`. Unknown routing keys become `default`.

Domain outcomes are `succeeded`, `failed`, `skipped`, `retried`, and `cancelled`. A successful Celery execution does not imply a successful domain operation. Code records domain results with `files.metrics.record_domain_outcome()`.

## Traces and logs

The web process configures Django tracing during WSGI startup. A Celery child configures tracing from `worker_process_init`, after the fork. Set `OTEL_SERVICE_ROLE` to `web`, `long-task`, `short-task`, `transcription`, `email`, or `beat`. All roles use the `CinemataCMS` service namespace by default.

`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` sets the ordinary trace ratio. `OTEL_PRIORITY_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` sets the ratio for Celery, media, transcription, HLS, and email spans. Parent sampling decisions propagate across queued work.

The deployment mode controls who owns the Collector. `local` installs the
repository's Collector, `managed` sends traces to a Collector managed by the
deployment, and `none` disables application tracing.

JSON logs add `trace_id`, `span_id`, `actor_ref`, `task_id`, `task_name`, and the
normalized queue. For an authenticated request, `actor_ref` is the same
versioned keyed reference used for an email recipient; the current request span
also carries `cinematacms.actor_ref`. This permits restricted incident lookup
without exporting an email address. A deployment may expose the token-protected
`POST /internal/observability/references` endpoint to its restricted monitoring
system. It resolves an actor email or public media token into the versioned,
keyed references used by telemetry without returning the input. Search logs by
`actor_ref` for general user activity or by `recipient_ref` for an email
delivery, then use the matching `trace_id` to follow downstream work. Span
filtering removes attributes whose names identify message bodies, addresses,
authorization data, secrets, passwords, filenames, or URLs. Restricted email
spans may contain only the delivery UUID, the recipient reference, the email
kind, and the attempt number.

## Error tracking

CinemataCMS uses the Sentry protocol for exception events. The application
does not select or deploy an event store. A deployment owns the DSN, projects,
retention, storage, backups, alerts, and access controls.

Error tracking is off when `SENTRY_DSN` is empty. `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` separates
deployment environments, and `SENTRY_RELEASE` identifies the deployed build.
`SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE` controls error-event sampling. The integration does not
send logs, traces, profiles, sessions, or default personal data.

The sanitizer removes request and transaction data, headers, cookies, query
strings, user data, breadcrumbs, performance spans, custom fingerprints, frame
variables, attachments, module inventories, SQL statements, email addresses,
and raw IP addresses. It keeps the exception type, a sanitized exception
message, stack locations, the release, the environment, the service role, and
trace identifiers. Native exception grouping remains enabled.

Django and Celery report exceptions that escape their execution boundaries.
Code that catches an unexpected `Exception` and returns a degraded result must
call `cms.error_tracking.capture_unexpected_exception()`. Expected validation,
permission, retry, media-processing, SMTP, rate-limit, and dependency outcomes
remain in the existing metrics and logs.

The permanent diagnostic endpoint is
`POST /internal/observability/error-probe`. It returns `404` unless
`ERROR_TRACKING_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` is true and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` is
`staging`. Nginx restricts the endpoint to loopback clients. Django also checks
the client address, the method, `ERROR_TRACKING_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN`, and a
fail-closed rate limit of at most 50 requests per hour. The endpoint ignores
the request body and raises a fixed exception.

Run `python manage.py verify_error_tracking` on a staging host to check both
the web process and the `long_tasks` Celery queue. The command posts through
the loopback Nginx route and dispatches the existing `sum_two_numbers_two`
diagnostic task. `--repeat` accepts values from 1 through 50. Keep diagnostics
disabled after the check. A deployment should retain error events for 30 days.

## Scheduled jobs

`cms.scheduled_jobs.SCHEDULED_JOBS` defines each job name, cadence, owner, and absence window. Scheduled-job metrics keep last-started and last-success timestamps separate. A skip does not update last success.

## Alert validation

`config/observability/alertability.json` maps each portable condition to its signal, semantic owner, bounded dimensions, data states, recovery condition, and initial guidance. `config/observability/fixtures.json` records healthy, degraded, unknown, and recovered inputs for representative condition families.

Validate the contract with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_observability_contract.py
uv run python scripts/validate_observability_coverage.py
make test TEST_ARGS="cms.tests.test_alertability_contract cms.tests.test_observability cms.tests.test_scheduled_jobs email_delivery"
```

Before implementation, map each feature to this contract and
`config/observability/coverage.json`. If the contract does not cover the
feature's operation, outcomes, dependencies, or operator workflow, extend the
coverage matrix and contract tests first. Follow
[Make new behavior observable](../../CODING_STANDARDS.md#make-new-behavior-observable)
for the required inventory, privacy, test, and operator-query fields.
